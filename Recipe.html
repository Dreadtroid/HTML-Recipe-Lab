<h1>Banana Bread</h1>
<h2>By: Elise Bauer</h2>
<h3>For this recipe, you will need:</h3>
 <ul>
  <li>1 1/4 to 1 1/2 cups of mashed bananas</li>
  <li>1/3 cup of butter </li>
  <li>1/2 teaspoon of baking soda</li>
  <li>1 pinch of salt</li>
  <li>3/4 cup of sugar</li>
  <li>1 large egg, beaten</li>
  <li>1 teaspoon of vanilla extract</li>
  <li>1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour</li>
  <li>8 x 4 inch loaf pan</li>
    </ul>
<h3>Baking instructions:</h3>
<ol>
  <li>Preheat the oven to 350°Fand butter 8 x 4 inch loaf pan.</li>
  <li>In a mixing bowl, mash the ripe bananas with a fork until completely smooth. Stir the melted butter into the mashed bananas.</li>
  <li>Mix in the baking soda and salt. Stir in the sugar, beaten egg, and vanilla extract. Mix in the flour.</li>
  <li>Pour the batter into your prepared loaf pan. Bake for 55 to 65 minutes at 350°F (175°C), or until a toothpick or wooden skewer inserted into the center comes out clean. A few dry crumbs are okay; streaks of wet batter are not. If the outside of the loaf is browned but the center is still wet, loosely tent the loaf with foil and continue baking until the loaf is fully baked. </li>
  <li> Remove from oven and let cool in the pan for a few minutes. Then remove the banana bread from the pan and let cool completely before serving. Slice and serve. (A bread knife helps to make slices that aren't crumbly.) Wrapped well, the banana bread will keep at room temperature for 4 days. For longer storage, refrigerate the loaf up to 5 days, or freeze it.</li>
    </ol>
<h3>Why this is my favorite recipe:</h3>
<p>This is my favorite recipe because it was a staple of my childhood. Whenever we had banana that went spolied we would just use them to make banana bread instead of throwing them in the trash. It made for a delicious dessert.</p>
